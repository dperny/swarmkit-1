package helpers

// The helpers package is a package from the allocator that includes common
// functions used throughout swarmkit and the allocator itself for verification
// and validation of objects. All of the functions in helpers are stateless and
// idempotent.
//
// Users not using the allocator should import `helpers` and not the allocator
// packages directly.
